# Internship_projects
Welcome to my repository! Here I have included the works I have done during my internship at DecisionOpt in OR profile.

Here is the brief overview:

1.Formulate TSP problem and solve in different solvers(ex-Gurobi,CBC) for 100 cities.

2.Tuning the parameters of Gurobi solver to optimize the code.

3.Creating an initial solution of TSP using Google OR tools and set this solution as an warm start to reduce the runtime.

4.Further optimizing the code by reducing no. of variables using domain knowledge of TSP(1.the salesman will traverse from one city to its top k nearest cities, 2.Salesman will be traverse from one city to another city within x km).
